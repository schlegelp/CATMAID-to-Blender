    - fixed get_annotations_from_list -> CATMAID returns now a list of dictionaries for each neuron:
      {'skeletons' : { 'skeleton ID' : [{'id': annotation id, 'uid' : dont know what this is}] , [....]}
       'annotations': {'annotation_id':'annotation_name', ... }
      }

        old: {'incoming': { 'neuronXY': {'skids': { 'upstream_neuronZ' : 5 } } }
        new: {'incoming': { 'neuronXY': {'skids': { 'upstream_neuronZ' : [0,0,2,1,2] } } }

### V3.81 14/07/2015
    - adjusted annotation import to fix new layout of received dict

### V3.8 29/06/2015
    - added option to color_by_pairs and load_paired: will color/load neurons based on given annotation
      'paired with #skid'

### V3.73 17/05/2015
    - added option to color_by_synapses: if 'shift color' is set, the color will only be changed
      by given value RELATIVE to it's current color
    - added option to filter by annotation when importing partners
        -> works only with a single annotation and has to be exact

    - added option to use curve's bevel_depth when exporting morphology

### V3.72 26/03/2015

    - added option to export connectors to SVG and give them mesh color (will apply to inputs AND outputs)

    - added option to randomize grayscale colors
    - added option to SVG exports to color by density of given CURVE object (e.g. DCV tracings)
        - alternatively: choose 'Synapses' as density object and it will load connectors
        -> added filter option: -'incoming' or 'outgoing' will include only post/presynaptic sites. If no filter is given, both are processed
                                -any other filter will be applied to the connected neurons' names!
    - added option to SVG morphology export to color arbors by ratio between post- and presynaptic sites
        - Keep in mind that the subdivision into arbors can be misleading, especially for very large arbors
    - added option to choose which views should be exported
    - added perspective to connector-to-svg export
    - added new perspective 'Perspective-Dorsal' and made it standard:
        - looks at the brain from behind at an elevated angle - comparable to squeeze mounting
    - added option to filter for synapse threshold when exporting connectors by using e.g. '>3'
    - fixed bug that occured when exporting connectors and a treenode has more than one connector upstream and led to all but one connectors be ignored

        called

### V3.52 09/09/2014
    - added check for latest version (update.txt at Github repository)

    V3.51 05/09/2014
    - changed server url to 'https://...'
    - removed subtype 'PASSWORD' from CATMAID Login as this seems to be bugged in Blender 2.71
      -> forces you to enter passwords in reverse


### V3.5 23/07/14
    - added orthographic perspective for export

### V3.4 13/07/14
    - added resampling option for importing and updating neurons
    - added option to skip connectors when importing

### V3.31 07/07/14
    - exchanged compact-json url for compact-skeleton url to retrieve morphology/connectors
    -> compact-json doesn't work anymore!!!
    -> neuron's names now have to be retrieved by separate get_neuronnames() function
    - fixed 'Retrieve Partners' (wouldn't check thresholds before)
    - minor clean ups

### V3.3 28/06/14
    - added function to also export neuron's morphology when exporting it's connectors to svg
    - fixed some bugs in legend creation of connector export (still quite some left)

### V3.22 26/06/2014
    - changed Blender operators polls to check if connection to CATMAID was successful
    -> buttons will be greyed out until connected to CATMAID server
    - newly imported neurons will have 'name', 'skeleton_id' and 'date_imported' assigned as custom properties

### V3.21 23/06/2014
    - changed request of skeleton name via ancestry to neuronnames -> requests a list instead of single names (MAJOR speed up!)
    -> removed progress bar for cursor
    - credentials will be read from txt file - if no file is found credentials will be empty

### V3.2 18/06/2014
    - added filter option to export connectors
    - added poll function to all Blender operators to gray out buttons if not connected to CATMAID server
        Note: just checks whether connection has been attempted, not if successfull
    - improved creation of legends for export connectors (probably still some glitches here)
    - added progress bar for cursor

### V3.1 16/06/2014
    - added color by spatial position (soma-based)

### V2.2
    - added lateral view
    - added option for scaled presynapse export

### V2.1
    - changed the way data is imported from CATMAID - should be almost as fast as CATMAIDs'
      3D viewer now
    - added connector retrieval from CATMAID to Blender and a SVG file:
        - both options require connecting to CATMAID!!!
        - will retrieve number of targets for all downstream connectors and resize
          nodes relative to that
        - won't affect upstream nodes as there is always only one presynaptic source

### V2.0
    - implemented support for CATMAID API to directly interact with database

### V1.2
    - changed NeuroML Import according to CATMAID Export changes (complete names exported)

### V1.1
    - made Import from NeuroML read data line-by-line instead of importing all at once
        -> didn't speed things up, but made it more stable and more reactive if necessary
    - added better monitoring of progress in system console while importing
    - NOTE: Creation of the Neurons seems to be the bottleneck
    - added 'Render All Function'. What it does:
        - Creates Cameras if neccessary and then does single neuron renders of all neurons
